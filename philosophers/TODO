FIX
when num_times_eat is over, everyone should sleep and think one last time

4 310 200 100 works
threads not being joined
4 200 205 200

threads only dont close if 


error check












pthread create recieves a pthread id, NULL, a function, and NULL
	said function has to be void *

pthread exit is like a return (not allowed)

pthread join makes execution stop at that line until the thread is terminated/complete

pthread detach makes it that it does not need to be joined when it terminates
	when the thread is done, resources are automatically released
