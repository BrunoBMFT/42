simulations dont end when dead

PHILOS DYING EVEN IF THEY EAT


weird: 
5 800 200 200 7
4 410 200 200 (shouldnt die) 



check if all threads have been created
error check
















notes
	//pthreadexit ensure that the thread resources are cleaned up
	//	and that the ret value is passed to pthreadjoin
	//using return (NULL) also returns the return value to pthreadjoin
	//threadexit explicitly terminates the thread, the other does it implicitly
	//both clean up the thread and return control to the calling thread

pthread create recieves a pthread id, NULL, a function, and NULL
	said function has to be void *

pthread exit is like a return (not allowed)

pthread join makes execution stop at that line until the thread is terminated/complete

pthread detach makes it that it does not need to be joined when it terminates
	when the thread is done, resources are automatically released 





Need to understand better
mutex is used to lock resources from other threads
	it locks from other threads access to a region of code

when a thread mutexes a part of the code, the other threads need to wait 
	for it to be done to be able to access that region of code

pthread mutex init initiates a pthread_mutex_t variable

pthread mutex destroy frees the mutex resources

pthread mutex lock locks that specific part of the code
and
pthread mutex unlock unlocks that same specific part
