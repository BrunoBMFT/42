wtf

make a file of settings, where the user can change the field of view, the speed of player, sens of turning, etc...














check map noborder.cub (if flood doesnt get to wrong border, what happens)

minimap:
while map[y]
{
	while map[y][x]
		paint_block(y, x)
}

paint_block
{
	if (map[y][x] == 1)
		color = white
	else map == 0
		color = grey
}

GAME:
puzzle/parkor game
you have a dash, it has 4 substeps to the dash. 
you only need floor on the 4th dash, 
	but if you hit any wall in an substep, you stop there
the substep distance will be shown by 2 pointers, showing you where you'll land
they will change to red if you are hitting anything
