check error messages
tests:
	cd folder && rm -rf ../folder
	env -i
	unset PATH (same fix as pipex)
	fix leaks in normal cases (no errors)
	fix leaks in error cases
	fix leaks in NULL cases?
test every malloc functions with NULLS and see if everything is freed and protected?
# define malloc(x) NULL?


change errors from writing minishell to writing bash
clean_exit receive error str?

switch things to getenv instead of ft_getenv?, no because getenv doesnt check our env
improve echo
rename variables
add colors to prompt
change SHELL=binzsh to shell=minishell
