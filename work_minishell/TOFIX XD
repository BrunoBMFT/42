Signals

FIX LEAKS!!! (redirs, job array, tokenize??)

< "" > ""
.|.

eval sheet:
$vempty
"" vs $empty
ctrl+c && ctrl+\ with blocking command (cat)
check printenv only gets 1 job.job (export without the = sign does things different)✅

TESTER:
echo hi > out | < out cat✅
redirections with strings
	also fucked up going into unquote
redirections are supposed to only do the last redirection, and give error on the first one✅
	it should check every redir to see if valid, if one isnt, process doesnt go forward✅
having multiple redir types, have to check

# Should skip the empty argument, and print hello after spaces
echo - "" "  " hello

errors from bash to minishell(output)

(weird ones)
./minishell MOREARGUMENTS
echo hello <> out

export 1=a | echo hi

make parse export better
parse_export and variable duplicates need to be checked before calloc (leaks?)

test with "" as commands (cat) (command not found, just a "")

check error messages
tests:
	env -i
	unset PATH (same fix as pipex)
	fix leaks in normal cases (no errors)
	fix leaks in error cases
	fix leaks in NULL cases?
test every malloc functions with NULLS and see if everything is freed and protected?
# define malloc(x) NULL?
